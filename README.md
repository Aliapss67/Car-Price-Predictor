# Car Price Predictor

---

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to **predict car prices** based on various technical and dimensional specifications. By analyzing attributes such as `enginesize`, `carlength`, `carwidth`, and `carheight`, the system aims to provide accurate price estimations. This can be a valuable tool for potential car buyers, sellers, and automotive market analysts to understand pricing dynamics.

## Key Features

* **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** Leverages `pandas` and `numpy` for efficient handling, cleaning, and preparation of car specification datasets.
* **Predictive Factors:** The model utilizes key numerical attributes like engine size, car length, car width, and car height to determine price. (If you use categorical features like `make`, `fueltype`, etc., mention them here too).
* **Machine Learning Model:** (Add the specific algorithm you used here, e.g., "Implements a **Linear Regression** model for continuous price prediction." or "Utilizes a **Random Forest Regressor** for robust price estimation.")
* **Model Evaluation:** Employs standard `sklearn.metrics` for assessing model performance, typically using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
* **Data Splitting:** Uses `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and unbiased evaluation.
* **Cross-Validation:** Incorporates `KFold` or `StratifiedKFold` (if you discretize prices for classification-like validation) for robust model evaluation, ensuring reliability and generalization across different data subsets.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* `numpy` (for numerical operations)
* `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (for basic data visualization)
* `scikit-learn` (for machine learning functionalities, including relevant regression models, `train_test_split`, `KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`, and `metrics`)

## Project Structure

The project is typically organized within a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file, guiding through the following sequential steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Setup:** Importing necessary libraries and loading the car dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial data exploration to understand feature distributions, correlations, and relationships with the target variable (price).
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features (if any), and scaling numerical features.
4.  **Model Training:** Training the chosen regression model on the prepared dataset.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using cross-validation and relevant regression metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6.  **Prediction:** Demonstrating how to make price predictions for new car specifications.

## How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Car-Price-Predictor.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Car-Price-Predictor.git)
    cd Car-Price-Predictor
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different).*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    *(You might also need `ipykernel` to run the Jupyter Notebook: `pip install ipykernel`)*

3.  **Obtain the dataset:**
    The dataset used for this project (containing car specifications and prices) is required. Place your `car_data.csv` (or whatever your dataset is named) file in the root directory of the cloned repository, or update the file path in the Jupyter Notebook accordingly.

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the project's `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Car_Price_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.
